## Hi there 👋

Hi all! 😊👋🏽 I'm excited to share, learn, and connect. Let us build something impactful together!

I’m a product engineer and connector, passionate about bridging the gap between data, products, and people.  
As a **Senior Data Scientist** at WTW, I translate complex business problems into clear user stories for developers to build, and transform raw data into actionable insights through interactive visualisations that support smarter, data-informed decision-making.

Previously, I worked at a fast-paced EdTech startup in Africa as a **Product Manager, Analytics**, where I owned the product journey from discovery through to the delivery of the MVP and Phase II launch of a customer-facing app. This involved conducting user research, aligning with stakeholders, prioritising features using a lean roadmap, and working iteratively with design and engineering to deliver a user-centric solution—ultimately resulting in increased product stickiness.

I hold an MSc in Data Science from Northumbria University, Newcastle. My go-to tools: **Python (Pandas), Mixpanel, SQL, Power BI**.

Across everything I do, I prioritise clarity, strategic impact, and scalable value.  
🔁 **We build analytics solutions and analysis that are easily configurable and scalable across clients—by design.**

Let’s connect and keep learning together!
