# 👋🏽 Let’s Build Something Impactful
I’m a product-minded data scientist and change agent, passionate about bridging the gap between data, products, and people to drive meaningful, real world impact.
Currently at **WTW**, I translate complex business problems into clear user stories for developers to build , and turn raw data into insights so businesses can sieze opportunities.
Prior, I worked in a fast-paced **EdTech startup in Africa as a Product Manager** where I owned the product journey from discovery to the delivery of the MVP and Phase II launch. I hold a MSc in Data Science at the University of Northumbria, Newcastle. Let's connect, free free to reach out on LinkedIn.

## 💬 My Approach
Across everything I do, I prioritise:
- **Clarity** in communication, visualisations, and set clear expectations on the scope to deliver. 
- **Strategic** impact through data storytelling
- **Scalable** solutions that are transferable across clients

🧐 **My core philosophy:** I invest deeply in understanding the problem space, aligning with stakeholders to define key business questions and identifying scalable solutions, especially in configurable environments. This method prevents us from being caught offguard. This upfront clarity ensures requirements and analysis are repeatable, adaptable, and built to onboard future clients seamlessly.
