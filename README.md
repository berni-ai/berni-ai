## Hi there 👋

Hi all! 😊👋🏽 I'm excited to share, learn, and connect. Let us build something impactful together!

I’m a product engineer and connector, passionate about bridging the gap between data, products, and people.  
As a **Senior Data Scientist** at WTW, I turn complex business problems into actionable insights through charts, tables, and compelling narratives that drive better decision-making.

Previously, I worked at a fast-paced EdTech startup in Africa as a **Product Analyst & Manager**, where I applied lean analytics principles—using experimentation, segmentation (RFM), and feedback loops to guide product improvements and reduce waste.

I hold an MSc in Data Science from Northumbria University, Newcastle. My go-to tools: **Python (Pandas), Mixpanel, SQL, Power BI**.

Across everything I do, I prioritise clarity, strategic impact, and scalable value.  
🔁 **We build analytics solutions and analysis that are easily configurable and scalable across clients—by design.**

Let’s connect and keep learning together!
