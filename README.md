# 👋🏽 Let’s Build Something Impactful

I’m a product-minded data scientist and change agent, passionate about bridging the gap between data, products, and people to drive meaningful, real-world impact.

Currently at **WTW**, I translate complex business problems into clear user stories, and craft actionable insights through interactive, user-centered visualisations.

Before that, I worked in a fast-paced **EdTech startup in Africa as a Product Manager, Analytics,** where I led the product journey from discovery to Phase II launch:

    Conducted user research and stakeholder alignment

    Prioritised features using lean, iterative roadmaps

    Delivered a customer-facing app

    Boosted product stickiness with user-centric design

I hold a MSc in Data Science at the University of Northumbria, Newcastle.

## 💬 My Approach

Across everything I do, I prioritise:

- Clarity in communication and visuals  
- Strategic impact through data storytelling  
- Scalable value — solutions that work across clients and contexts

I believe great analytics are not just technically brilliant — they’re thoughtfully designed to be reusable, accessible, and aligned with real-world needs.
