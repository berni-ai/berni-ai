# 👋🏽 Let’s Build Something Impactful
I’m a product-minded data scientist and change agent, passionate about bridging the gap between data, products, and people to drive meaningful, real-world impact.
Currently at **WTW**, I translate complex business problems into clear user stories for developers to build , and turn raw data into insights so the business does not miss the window to act.
Before that, I worked in a fast-paced **EdTech startup in Africa as a Product Manager, Analytics,** where I owned the product journey from discovery to the delivery of the MVP and Phase II launch. I hold a MSc in Data Science at the University of Northumbria, Newcastle.

🧐 **My core philosophy:** I invest deeply in understanding the problem space aligning with stakeholders to define meaningful business questions and identifying scalable approaches, especially in configurable environments. This approach prevents us from being caught offguard. This upfront clarity ensures analysis is repeatable, adaptable, and built to onboard future clients seamlessly.
