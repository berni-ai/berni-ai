# 👋🏽 Let’s Build Something Impactful
I’m a product-minded data scientist and change agent, passionate about bridging the gap between data, products, and people to drive meaningful, real-world impact.

Currently at **WTW**, I translate complex business problems into clear user stories, and craft actionable insights through interactive, user-centered visualisations.

Before that, I worked in a fast-paced **EdTech startup in Africa as a Product Manager, Analytics,** where I led the product journey from discovery to the delivery of the MVP and Phase II launch:

I hold a MSc in Data Science at the University of Northumbria, Newcastle.

Across everything I do, I prioritise:

I believe great analytics are not just technically brilliant — they’re thoughtfully designed to be reusable, scalable, and aligned with business needs.
